# Eskenzi PR — AI Automation Proposal Report
## Prepared by Scooper AI

---

## 1. Company Overview

**Company:** Eskenzi PR and Marketing
**Website:** https://eskenzipr.com
**Industry:** Cybersecurity Public Relations & Marketing
**Founded:** ~1999 (25+ years in operation)
**Headquarters:** London, England, UK
**Global Offices:** UK, US (East & West Coast), France, Germany, APAC (Singapore), Middle East (Dubai)
**Team Size:** ~17 employees
**Estimated Revenue:** ~$5.5M/year
**Founders:** Yvonne Eskenzi & Neil Stinchcombe

### What They Do
Eskenzi PR is a specialist cybersecurity PR and marketing agency — widely regarded as the leading agency in the cybersecurity niche globally. They offer PR, media relations, analyst relations, content marketing, brand strategy, social media marketing, crisis management, media training, and reputation management — all exclusively for cybersecurity and information security companies.

### Who Their Clients Are
Cybersecurity vendors, startups, scale-ups, and enterprise companies. They've worked with 300+ clients over their history, including notable names like KnowBe4, Cybereason, CyberArk, Varonis, Imperva, Outpost24, Cato Networks, Keeper Security, and Proofpoint. They have a strong track record of helping clients reach IPO or acquisition — having been involved in deals worth over $30 billion.

### Business Model
Retainer-based PR agency model. Clients stay an average of 7 years (longest: 17 years with Infosecurity Europe). They use a "follow the sun" approach with global teams covering different time zones. Their tools include Cision, TrendKite, HubSpot, and Rapid Response.

### Key Differentiators
- 30 years of cybersecurity-exclusive focus
- 89% of clients ranked 1st or 2nd in share of voice (2023)
- Generated 1,000+ headlines in 2024
- Organize major industry events: Most Inspiring Women in Cyber Awards, European Cybersecurity Bloggers Awards, Security Serious Unsung Heroes Awards, IT Security Analyst & CISO Forum
- Deep journalist relationships in cybersecurity media (BBC, Forbes, WSJ, NYT, Bloomberg, Dark Reading, SC Media, Infosecurity Magazine, etc.)

### Scale & Operational Reality
With only ~17 staff serving a global client base across multiple time zones and running several major annual events, this is a lean, high-performing team. That means every hour of operational efficiency matters enormously. They're likely stretched across client servicing, media monitoring, content creation, event management, and new business development.

## 2. Operational Pain Points (Industry + Company-Specific)

Based on research into PR agency operations and Eskenzi's specific profile, here are the key time sinks:

### Pain Point 1: Media Monitoring & Coverage Tracking
PR teams spend an estimated 2-3 hours per day per account executive scanning media outlets, social channels, and news aggregators for client mentions, competitor activity, and breaking cybersecurity stories. For a "follow the sun" agency like Eskenzi, this is multiplied across time zones. Compiling coverage reports, creating clip books, and preparing weekly "Friday WOW" roundups (which they visibly do on LinkedIn) consumes significant time.

### Pain Point 2: Client Reporting & Performance Dashboards
Monthly and weekly client reports require pulling data from Cision, TrendKite, social media analytics, and other tools — then manually formatting into client-ready presentations. With 10-15+ active clients and global coverage to track, this likely consumes 1-2 hours per client per reporting cycle. Share of voice calculations, sentiment analysis, and coverage quality assessments add complexity.

### Pain Point 3: Media Outreach & Journalist Coordination
Crafting personalized pitches for different journalists across cybersecurity trade press, national media, and broadcast outlets in multiple countries. Tracking who's been pitched, who responded, follow-up sequences, embargo management, and coordinating interview schedules between clients and journalists across time zones. Estimated 2-3 hours/day across the team.

### Pain Point 4: Content Creation Workflow
Creating monthly thought-leadership content, press releases, byline articles, blog posts, and social media content for each client. The briefing, drafting, review, approval, and distribution cycle involves multiple back-and-forth communications. With cybersecurity being a technically dense field, content requires accuracy checks and client sign-off.

### Pain Point 5: Event Management & Logistics
Running 4+ major annual events (awards ceremonies, forums, conferences) while maintaining client PR campaigns is a massive operational burden for a 17-person team. Nomination tracking, judging coordination, attendee management, speaker scheduling, and sponsor communications are largely manual.

### Pain Point 6: New Business & Client Onboarding
Responding to inbound inquiries, preparing proposals, conducting competitor research for prospects, and onboarding new clients (setting up monitoring, building media lists, creating messaging frameworks) are resource-intensive and often inconsistent.

## 3. The Cost of These Inefficiencies

### Industry Benchmarks (Conservative Estimates)

- **Time on admin vs. strategic work:** PR professionals typically spend 40-60% of their time on operational/administrative tasks rather than strategic counsel and relationship building (based on industry surveys from Cision and PR industry reports).

- **Missed reactive opportunities:** In cybersecurity PR, breaking news response time is critical. A delay of even 30-60 minutes can mean a client misses a journalist's deadline. Estimated 15-25% of reactive media opportunities are missed due to delayed awareness or slow coordination.

- **Reporting overhead:** Agencies typically spend 5-8 hours per client per month on reporting alone. For 12+ clients, that's 60-96 hours/month — equivalent to one full-time person doing nothing but reports.

- **Client churn risk from slow response:** Industry data suggests that 30-40% of client dissatisfaction in PR stems from perceived lack of proactiveness and slow response times — not lack of results.

- **Revenue capacity constraint:** With 17 staff, Eskenzi is capacity-constrained. Every hour freed from operational tasks is an hour that can go toward servicing additional clients or deepening strategic value for existing ones.

### Estimated Annual Impact
- **£150,000–£250,000/year in new revenue capacity** — automations free enough bandwidth to take on 2-3 additional clients at typical cybersecurity PR retainers of £5,000–£10,000/month, without hiring
- **£60,000–£120,000/year in retained revenue protected** — faster response times, richer reporting, and increased proactiveness reduce churn risk. Preventing even one client loss per year preserves a full retainer over the remaining average client lifetime (7 years)
- **£50,000–£80,000/year in recovered team capacity** — hours currently consumed by manual monitoring, reporting, and coordination redirected to strategic counsel, relationship building, and new business development
- **10-15% more media placements captured** — AI-powered real-time monitoring catches breaking cybersecurity stories across time zones, enabling the team to react before competitors even when the relevant office is offline
- **Event revenue growth potential** — with 40-50% less admin burden per event, Eskenzi could scale from 4 to 5-6 annual events or deepen monetization of existing ones through better sponsor management

**Total estimated annual value: £400,000–£600,000/year** when accounting for new revenue capacity, retained client value, operational savings, and improved placement rates.

## 4. The Opportunity: What Automation Could Look Like

### Today vs. Automated

- **24/7 reactive coverage** — AI catches breaking stories across time zones even when the team is offline
- **30-40% faster** pitch-to-placement cycle through automated follow-up and coordination
- **2-3 additional clients** serviceable with existing headcount — £150K–£250K/year in new revenue capacity
- **2-3x event management capacity** through automated workflows

## 8. Presentation Content Notes

### Key Messaging Angles for the Presentation

**Primary narrative:** Eskenzi PR has built an extraordinary reputation over 30 years with a small, brilliant team. Automation isn't about replacing that team — it's about giving them superpowers. When a 17-person agency can operate with the efficiency of a 25-person one, the result is better client outcomes, more media placements, and the capacity to grow without the growing pains.

**Emotional hook:** "You built a world-class agency on relationships and instinct. Automation handles everything else — so your team can focus on what made Eskenzi the industry's golden standard."

**Key stats to emphasize in slides:**
- 30 years of cybersecurity PR expertise
