## Slide 2: Current Reality

### Section Label: Current Reality

### Heading: Where Time Goes Today

**Intro:** Running a solo-provider Direct Primary Care clinic in rural Wyoming means wearing many hats. Between delivering exceptional patient care and managing day-to-day operations, administrative tasks consume hours that could be spent building patient relationships.

### Tasks That Consume Time:

| Task | Time Estimate | Consequence |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Phone calls for appointment scheduling | 1.5-2 hrs/day | Interrupts patient care, missed calls during visits |
| Manual follow-up reminders | 45 min-1 hr/day | No-shows, forgotten appointments, revenue loss |
| Responding to patient portal messages | 1-1.5 hrs/day | Delayed responses, patient frustration |
| New patient intake & paperwork processing | 30-45 min/patient | Longer wait times, data entry errors |
| Membership enrollment & billing inquiries | 45 min-1 hr/day | Cash flow delays, subscription lapses |
| DOT physical & drug testing coordination | 30-45 min/day | Scheduling conflicts, employer dissatisfaction |

### Summary Stat:
"This adds up to **40-50% of operational hours** on tasks that don't require clinical judgment—time that could be spent with patients or growing membership."
